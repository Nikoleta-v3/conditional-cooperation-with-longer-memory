# Conditional Cooperation with Longer Memory

This repository contains files for the project `Conditional Cooperation with
Longer Memory`.

More specifically, it includes all the files necessary to compile the written
notes and for our analysis.

### Manuscript

The written notes are in LaTeX. To compile the document, one needs the
`main.tex`, the `bibliography.bib`, and the folder `figures`.

### Code

The analysis has been carried out using Python and MATLAB.

The evolutionary simulations have been performed in MATLAB. The files can be
found in `src/evolution_simulations`.

Python was used to numerically explore Nash equilibria. The source code can be
found in `src/numerical_nash`. For exploring Nash strategies numerically, we
used another Python package that we implemented named [repeated_play](https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/repeated_play).

The analysis was done in Jupyter Notebooks. These can be found in the folder
`notebooks`. One can run these notebooks as normal. No special packages were used.

### Data

The data generated by the simulations and analyses can be found here:
