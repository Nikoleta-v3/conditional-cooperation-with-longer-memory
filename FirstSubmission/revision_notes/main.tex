%% DEFECTING STRATEGIES: Donation Game %%

\section{Reactive defecting Nash strategies in the donation game}\label{section:defecting_donation_game}

In the previous section, we have characterized the reactive partner strategies
for a special case of the donation game and the general prisoner's dilemma. In
the following, we apply the same methods based on Section~\ref{Sec:Algorithm} to
analyze defecting Nash equilibria. For the case of reactive-1 strategies, we
obtain the following characterization.

%% DEFECTING STRATEGIES: Reactive-1 Donation Game %%

\begin{theorem}[Reactive-1 defecting Nash strategies in the donation game]
\label{theorem:reactive_one_defecting_strategies}
A reactive-1 strategy $\mathbf{p}$ is a defecting Nash strategy if and only if
its entries satisfy the conditions

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    p_{C} \le  \frac{c}{b} \qquad \text{ and } \qquad  p_{D} \!=\! 0.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}


%% DEFECTING STRATEGIES: Reactive-2 Donation Game %%

\begin{theorem}[Reactive-2 defecting Nash strategies in the donation game]
\label{theorem:reactive_two_defecting_strategies}
A reactive-2 strategy $\mathbf{p}$ is a defecting Nash strategy if and only if
its entries satisfy the conditions

\begin{equation}\label{eq:defecting_conditions_two}
  p_{CC} \le \frac{c}{b}, \qquad \displaystyle \frac{p_{CD} \!+\! p_{DC}}{2} \le \frac{c}{2b}, \qquad p_{DD} = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

%% DEFECTING STRATEGIES: Reactive-3 Donation Game %%

\begin{theorem}[Reactive-3 defecting Nash strategies in the donation game]
\label{theorem:reactive_three_defecting_strategies}
A reactive-3 strategy $\mathbf{p}$ is a defecting Nash strategy if and only if
its entries satisfy the conditions

\begin{align}\label{eq:three_bit_conditions_defecting}
  \begin{split}
  p_{CCC} & \le \frac{c}{b} \\
  \frac{p_{CDC} + p_{DCD}}{2} & \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{c}{b} \\
  \frac{p_{CCD} + p_{CDC} + p_{DCC}}{3} & \leq \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{c}{b} \\
  \frac{p_{CDD} + p_{DCD} + p_{DDC}}{3} & \leq \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{c}{b} \\
  \frac{p_{CCD} + p_{CDD} + p_{DCC} + p_{DDC}}{4}  & \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{c}{b}  \\
  p_{DDD} & = 0.
  \end{split}
\end{align}

\end{theorem}

\noindent
We can observe that for each value of \(n\), the left-hand side of the
conditions for cooperative and defective Nash are the same. Moreover, it is
clear that the right-hand side of the defective Nash conditions is always
strictly smaller than those of the cooperative Nash conditions. This means that
within the space of feasible strategies, the volume of partner strategies is
always larger than the volume of defective Nash strategies. We verified these
analytical results numerically as well.

We selected random strategies from the feasible space of strategies and created
two copies of each strategy. For one copy, we set the probability of cooperating
after full cooperation of the co-player to 1 (for example, for reactive-1, \(p_{C} = 1\)). 
For the second copy, we set the probability of cooperating after
full defections of the co-player to 0 (for example, for reactive-2, \(p_{DD} =
0\)). We then checked if either copy is Nash: cooperative for the first and
defective for the second. We repeated this process for \(10^4\) randomly
selected strategies and plotted the relative volumes of cooperative and
defective Nash equilibria (Figure~\ref{fig:reactive_volume}). We also verified
that this holds true for different values of cost.

set the benefit of cooperation to \(b = 1\).

\noindent
Nash strategies are best response to themselves. This makes them robust against
invasion. In the stochastic evolutionary processes considered in this work, this
doesn't mean they cannot be invaded, but rather it makes it harder to do so. The
volumes of cooperative Nash and defective Nash strategies can determine the
evolutionary dynamics of cooperation. That is, they indicate the likelihood that
a randomly selected strategy will produce sustained cooperation or defection.
Therefore, since the volume of cooperative Nash increases with memory, and
defective Nash decreases, we expect that as memory increases, the cooperation
rate of the evolved population will also increase. This expectation is verified
by the results in \textbf{Figure 4} of the paper.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Evolutionary Simulations  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Evolutionary Simulations}

In this section, we will analyze the results of the evolutionary simulations to
better understand the dynamics of the different strategies. As a reminder, in
Fig. 3 of the manuscript panel, we simulated the evolutionary process twenty
times, independent simulations for reactive-n strategies, and for reactive-n
counting strategies. In panel A, we show for each of the three different memory
values the strategies that were the most abundant from each simulation.

Now, one question that arises is how many of these strategies are actually
partner strategies? And for the partner strategies, do we see all of them
represented?

**Reactive-1 strategies.** In the case of reactive-1, all the most abundant
strategies are partner strategies. However, from Eq. and for a given value of c,
the probability of defecting is... However, we observe only a lower value of \(
p_{dd} \), thus only some partner strategies are residents. This result is not
explained by the theory. To better understand this result, we need to do an
invasion analysis. For the invasion analysis, we consider a given resident
strategy, and we sample \( 10^3 \) random strategies to estimate if this mutant
will invade the resident. We record the number of mutants that took over. We
repeat this \( 10^3 \) times. The results are shown in Fig. X, and what we
observe is that a lower value of \( p_{dd} \) results in a more robust strategy
to invasion, as only cooperative strategies on the GTFT can take over, in
comparison with panel B where defective strategies are more likely to invade.

**Reactive-2 strategies.** In the case of reactive-2, we observe that almost all
strategies are partner strategies. However, what seems to be the case is that \(
p_{dc} \) is higher on average than \( p_{cd} \). In order to understand this,
we again run an invasion analysis. This time we also consider two values of \(
p_{dd} \). The results are shown in Fig. Y.

%% Errors  %%

\section{Errors}

So far, we have considered the case where there cannot be a mistake in the
actions taken by a player; the actions of the players are realized without
error. Here, we discuss what happens in the case where such an error is
possible. More specifically, we consider that \(\epsilon\) is the probability
that a player makes a mistake in the action taken.
