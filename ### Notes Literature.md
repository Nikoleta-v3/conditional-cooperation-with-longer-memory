### Small Groups and long memories promote cooperation

- Opening paragraph has a good reference for applications
- More references about memory studies, 22-25.
- Intro, second to last paragraph is a good paragraph 
- Ref 31 for the new figure in the SI with the defective and cooperative Nash
- they do this weird transformation
- then because the payoffs in the public's good game only depend on the amount of cooperation
  they focus on memory counting strategies.
- they then get a different system for representing the counting strategies.
- This new system has 5 components.
- For them counting strategies lead to a higher cooperation rates,
  because of the volume and because it's easier for them to invade other populations.

  ### Reactive learning strategies for iterated games

- They look at what they call reactive learning strategies, they use as an
  input the actions of the co-player to decide on an action. Now since these
  strategies learn as the game proceeds then they are considered long memory
  strategies. They show that there is a subset that is memory-one, reactive-1
  specifically. So I am assuming you can map these to any reactive-n strategy
  is you really tried.
  The main result of the paper is to show that the payoffs of a memory-1 strategy
  are constrained when playing against these reactive learning players.
