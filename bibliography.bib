@article{allen:AmNat:2013,
	abstract = {Abstract Evolutionary dynamics depend critically on a population's
	interaction structure---the pattern of which individuals interact
	with which others, depending on the state of the population and the
	environment. Previous research has shown, for example, that cooperative
	behaviors disfavored in well-mixed populations can be favored when
	interactions occur only between spatial neighbors or group members.
	Combining the adaptive dynamics approach with recent advances in
	evolutionary game theory, we here introduce a general mathematical
	framework for analyzing the long-term evolution of continuous game
	strategies for a broad class of evolutionary models, encompassing
	many varieties of interaction structure. Our main result, the canonical
	equation of adaptive dynamics with interaction structure, characterizes
	expected evolutionary trajectories resulting from any such model,
	thereby generalizing a central tool of adaptive dynamics theory.
	Interestingly, the effects of different interaction structures and
	update rules on evolutionary trajectories are fully captured by just
	two real numbers associated with each model, which are independent
	of the considered game. The first, a structure coefficient, quantifies
	the effects on selection pressures and thus on the shapes of expected
	evolutionary trajectories. The second, an effective population size,
	quantifies the effects on selection responses and thus on the expected
	rates of adaptation. Applying our results to two social dilemmas,
	we show how the range of evolutionarily stable cooperative behaviors
	systematically varies with a model's structure coefficient.},
